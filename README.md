Some works on Artificial intelligence.

AStar-Algorithm proposes a generic A*-Algorithm implementation, and applies it to two distinct search in a solution space problems:
- EightTilesPuzzle : generates a random 8 tiles puzzle and solves it, printing the number of moves made.
- MazeSolver: given a maze where S represents the start (initial) point, G the exit (or goal), # a wall, and ' ' an aisle, solves it and 
  prints out the solution.
